# This is a comprehensive repository dedicated to master core  DSA concepts through manual implementation.
## Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
 Data structures manage how data is stored and accessed. Algorithms focus on processing this data. The examples of data structures are Array, Queue,Stack etc. The examples of algorithms are binary search, quick sort and merge sort.
# The types of data structures are :
# 1.Linear Data Structure
->In linear data structures, the elements in the linear data structure are arranged sequentially where each element is connected to the previous and next adjancent elements.
Its examples are:
1.Arrays
2.Stacks
3.Queues
4.Linked Lists
# 2.Non-linear Data Structure
->In non-linear data structures, the elements are not arranged sequentially and form a hierarchial or networked arrangement.
Its examples are:
1.Trees
2.Graphs
3.Hash Tables
4.Heaps
